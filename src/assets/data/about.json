            "description": "My passion for STEM developed from a young age. I was fascinated by the patterns and order by which numbers arranged themselves. I excelled in mathematics throughout primary and secondary school, and discovered an innate passion for physics and programming. This led me to pursuing a mechatronics engineering degree at The University of Melbourne. Through my experiences volunteering with not-for-profit organisations - including the Melbourne Space Program and In2Science - and my work experience with CubeSat constellations & High-Altitude-Platform (HAP) technologies, I quickly discovered that developing space-technology and space exploration was a career path I desperately wanted to pursue."
